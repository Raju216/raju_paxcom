      <h3>Manage order returns and cancellations</h3>
      <p>One challenge with e Commerce is that if number of orders is huge, so is the number of returns. Many online buyers purchase products on impulse decision, and by the time they received the product at their home they have changed their minds and make use of favourable return policies. Studies suggest that by 2020 ECommerce in India would have 10%-15% return rate. Are you managing your return efficiently on time?? </p>
